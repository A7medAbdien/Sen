# Senior Project

1. build measuring application, Week 4
2. build duplicate images detected until the detection process, Week 5
3. try to edit it to measure the distance b/w what images got detected, Week 6
4. place an object on human body, Week 7
5. place an object on human body and measure the distance, Week 7

## Project 1: Build measuring application

[all learning](https://all-learning.com/android-arcore-distance-from-camera/)
did not work, so i will build it on hello world ARCore,

hit test -> depth images and cloud points
features points -> understand the nature of the object/surface -> pose

Poses can change as ARCore improves its understanding of its own position and its environment -> anchor

What is frame in camera?
Camera Framing Definition

Camera framing is the placement and position of the subjects in your shots. Shots are all about composition. Rather than pointing the camera at the subject, you need to compose an image
