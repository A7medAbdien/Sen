# Senior Project

1. build measuring application, Week 4
2. build duplicate images detected until the detection process, Week 5
3. try to edit it to measure the distance b/w what images got detected, Week 6
4. place an object on human body, Week 7
5. place an object on human body and measure the distance, Week 7

## Project 1: Build measuring application

[all learning](https://all-learning.com/android-arcore-distance-from-camera/)
did not work, so i will build it on hello world ARCore,

hit test -> depth images and cloud points
features points -> understand the nature of the object/surface -> pose

Poses can change as ARCore improves its understanding of its own position and its environment -> anchor

Camera framing is the placement and position of the subjects in your shots. Shots are all about composition. Rather than pointing the camera at the subject, you need to compose an image

## Project 1.2: Build an app that when detect the image shows the distance

1. detect the image, [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiLra7jntsk&t=6s)
2. manipulate the code

### issues

all attempts to create an Ar project form the scratch failed,
more understanding for gradle files is needed.

Projects used:

1. AR Core hello world (Java and Kotlin)
2. EasyLearn, place an object on tab (Java)
3. Measure the distance (Kotlin)

### solutions

use the existing AR project, EasyLearn as a template, but the code will be just in java

## Project 2: Build duplicate images detected until the detection process

[shibui Yusuke](https://shibuiyusuke.medium.com/)

## Project 3: Try to edit it to measure the distance b/w what images got detected

## Project 4: Place an object on human body

[Body Tracking issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57389303/is-there-any-way-to-detect-body-parts-from-vuforia)

1. find resources
2. understand the code
3. implementation

### Project 4.1: Place object on human face

## Project 5: Place an object on human body and measure the distance
