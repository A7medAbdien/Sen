# 1 intro

Safe Distance App:
In the midst of the challenge to battle the COVID-19 virus from outbreaking is to stop its transmission. One of the healthy precautionary methods applied to avoid transmission of the virus is to keep a safe distance between people. 
In this project, students are required to develop a mobile application that uses augmented reality and 3d modeling (or any alternative tools) on moving objects using the mobile camera. 
The application measures the distance between the mobile and any moving object. 
If the distance between the mobile and any object approaching the mobile is shorter than the predefined distance, the mobile sounds an alert.

--- 

We would like to apologize to whom might be negatively affected by opening this topic again. Our deepest condolences to the families of the Corona victims. During the sparid of the COVID-19 virus, 2019-2020, the Bahrain government ensured the importance of keeping a social distance as a healthy precautionary method applied to avoid transmission of the virus (dadada). Therefore, this project was developed with the purpose of helping people to apply social distance. Gratefully that the sparid this virus and social distance is no longer a major concern (dadada).

Although the project and the period of the virus spread are related. It would be unfair to think that the project would only be active during the critical period of its spread. what this project is trying to offer, in addition to solving the technical problem, is to contribute to the treatment of the psychological impact of what was left of that crisis. Using Augmented reality technologies that are related to entertaining experiences to solve such a problem will help to meet the project objectives.

We developed three applications. The first application is an Android application that works on a single image. It captures a single image using ARCore and passes it to the machine learning model provided by ML Kit to detect human pose, then render the captured image using OpenGL. If there is any person detected it will try to place an anchor on it, then this anchor will be used to calculate the distance between the camera device and the detected person.
The second application is an android application that works on a stream of images. It uses the CameraX analysis use case to pass the camera images to ML Kit human pose detector and renders landmarks over the detected person using ML Kit GraphicOverlay classes. We use the result of detected shoulders and hips for a person to measure how far from the camera the person is. We use a polynomial equation to get the actual distance based on the distance between the shoulders and hips.
The third application is a web application developed using Flask works on a stream of images. It uses the OpenCV API to get the camera images and pass them to Mvonet multi-pose detector. The Movnet model is loaded by TensorFlow-Hub API. Then rendering landmarks on detected persons using OpenCV. Measuring the distance is done in the same way that is used in the second application, using a polynomial equation.

## 1.1 Problem Statement

In the midst of the challenge to battle the COVID-19 virus from outbreaking is to stop its transmission. One of the healthy precautionary methods applied to avoid transmission of the virus is to keep a safe distance between people. Predicting the distance is a crucial process and it is not easy for everyone. Children are not aware of how they measure the distance until a certain age. Providing an application that helps in measuring the distance between people assists in applying healthy precautionary methods.


## 1.2 Project Objectives


The project aims to provide an application that uses the camera device to measure the distance between a mobile and any detected person with high usability.
The solution will:
* Provide a simple and user-friendly interface that targets users 6 years old or above
* Access the device camera and get its data to pass this data to the Machine Learning model
* Implement Machine Learning (ML) to detect any person in the camera scene
* Provide feedback when a person got detected e.g, a digital overlay on top of the detected person.
* Measure the distance between the mobile camera and the detected person
* Alert the user when any violation for predefined distance violated

## 1.3 Relevance/Significance of the project

The importance of this project lies in the ability to measure the distance between the device camera and a detected person.
We applied two approaches to measuring the distance. The first approach is based on 3 dimensional understanding of the environment, the approach will be discussed in section 6.4. This approach by itself is not unique, but applying it to measure the distance between the device camera and the detected person for a native Android application is what makes it unique. This application developed to work on a single image
The second approach is based on 2 dimensional understanding of the camera image, it will be explained in section 6.3.3. We developed two applications using this approach, one a native Android application and the other a web-based application. Both applications work on a stream of images.

work.

## Augmented Reality Definition

based on Helen Papagiannis book, she mentioning that the augmented reality has been defined as digital overlay on top of the real
world, consisting of computer graphics, text, video, and audio, which is
interactive in real time since 1997.

## 2.1 Related Systems
2.2.1 ARCore Measurement


Proposes a solution to recognize the 3 dimensional space using augmented reality technology. 
This will allow the application to measure distances of space. The application measures three distances: 
1. Distance from the camera
2. Distance between two points
3. Distance between multiple points

This is an android application written in Kotlin. It uses ARCore and SceneForm APIs to provide the AR chrechrteristic for the application. in this application distance measurement is triggered  by onClick listener, which means that we have to click on the device screen to specify the points that we want to measure distances between or form.

2.2.2 ML Kit Sample

Proposes a solution to assist governments in monitoring city pollution by combining user
feedback/reports with real-time data obtained by specialized mobile IoT sensors dynamically
re-located by government personnel to verify the claimed conditions of specific locations.
Through machine learning techniques, the mobile devices use dedicated sensors to monitor air
quality and collect primary road traffic situations. The system exposes a mobile application and
a website to facilitate the collecting of citizen reports and the display of collected data to both
institutions and end-users. The suggested method has been prototyped at a medium-sized
university campus as a proof-of-concept. Both the performance and functional validation
proved the system's viability and efficacy, allowing for the identification of certain lessons
learned as well as future
development

The application aims to provide usage and integration examples for various vision-based ML Kit capabilities. It is an android application written in Kotlin and Java. The user has the choice to choose which language is used to function the application. This application is provided by Google as one of the samples for demonstrating ML Kit features and use cases. The application has nine use cases:
1. Object Detection
2. Face Detection
3. Face Mesh Detection
4. Pose Detection
5. Text Recognition
6. Barcode Scanning
7. Custom Image Labeling - Birds
8. Image Labeling
9. Selfie Segmentation

The project activity plan is a list of the project activities and an approximation of their start and
end date. This gives the team, a clear path to follow and an idea based on approximation on
how much time would each activity requires.

the project activity plan is how to complete a project in a certain timeframe, by dividing it into activities with approximated start and end dates. The project activity plan worked as an indicator for any potential risk, when an activity exceeded its estimated time. It helped in balance between applying the main functionality and enhancing an existing one.


In order to solve the problem in the given period of time, we break the main problem into smaller problems:
1. measuring distance between the device camera and any other point in the scene
2. detect human body
3. integrate human body detector and measuring distance.  

The project was proposed and given a total of 6 months to be implemented. As such, a Spiral Software Development Life Cycle model was chosen to be followed throughout the project‚Äôs development. Each cycle of the Spiral Model is divided into four phases: Planning, Design, construction and evaluation. The reason for adopting the spiral model is that the tools for implementing this project were unclear and the spiral approach, is a risk-driven process model (Boehm and Hansen, 2000). 

We implemented the project over five cycles if the spiral model. The first cycle covered the low fidelity prototype and the second cycle covered the high fidelity prototype, both low and high fidelity prototypes will be discussed in chapter 4. the third cycle covered an application that detect on single image, this application will be discussed in the next section. The last cycle covered an application that detection on image stream.

Name: Dana
Age: 7
Education: Online School
Hometown: Bahrain
Occupation: Childhood

Goals:
* Easy and enjoyable user interface
* Measure the distance between the camera device and a detected person

Frustrations:
* Predicting and measuring the safe distance are default processes

Scenario:
Dana is a primary school student. She lives in a family house. When she plays with her relatives, she would like to know if she is keeping a safe distance or not. She still does not know how to predict two meters, so she uses the safe distance application. She allows the application to access the camera device and adjust the distance to two meters. She opens the camera and checks if she is keeping a safe distance between her and her relatives. 

# 5 sys des

Figure X shows the four main objects used in the Measuring distance application. All four objects depend on user events. The system application is the main logic that controls the application settings, permissions, and what the user sees. The camera object is responsible for accessing and communicating with the device camera. The detector object is responsible for detecting extracted features and getting their orientation in the image. The renderer object is responsible for calculating the distance between the detected object and the camera device and draw lines on detected person.

Step 1: The user touches the screen to start the application.
Step 2: The application system opens the device camera.
Step 3: The camera gets live streaming data and processes them to match the detector input.
Step 4: If there is a detected object, the renderer gets created and receives the orientations of the detected object. 
Step 5: The renderer calculates the distance between the detected object and the camera device.
Step 6: In case the calculated distance (in step 5) is less than the safe distance, the renderer will send an alert to the application system.
Step 7: the application system shows the user an alert message.
Step 8: If there is a detected object, The renderer draws lines on the detected person.

Start Camera: The user start the camera device and it measure the distance between the detected object and the camera. The user can show lines between person poses and current distance between the detected person on this person. The user can show the detection information, like frame rate, image size and detection latency. If the current distance between the detected person and the camera is less than the safe distance, an alert will be shown.
Change Settings: The user can hide detection information, lines between person poses and the current distance that rendered on the detected person. The user can use the device GPU rather then CPU.

# 6 sys imp

We implemented three versions of the application. The first application differs from the other in the way that it understands the environment and measures the distance, which will be discussed in section 6.4. The difference between the other two applications is that one is a web-based application and the other is an Android application.

## camera 

1. CameraX Use Case

First we create a CameraX instance, `cameraProvider`, and bind it to the lifecycle of the application. The `cameraProvider` will be used to bind the CameraX use cases to the application lifecycle. We uses ViewModelProvider that provides ViewModels. ViewModel is a class that is responsible for preparing and managing the data for an Activity. Then, we use CameraXViewModel class which is responsible for interacting with CameraX tp access processCameraProvider. The processCameraProvider is a method of the CameraXViewModel class that returns the LiveData that can be observed over the application lifecycle.

```java
class CameraXLivePreviewActivity :
  AppCompatActivity(), CompoundButton.OnCheckedChangeListener {
    private var cameraProvider: ProcessCameraProvider? = null
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        ViewModelProvider(this, ViewModelProvider.AndroidViewModelFactory.getInstance(application))
            .get(CameraXViewModel::class.java)
            .processCameraProvider
            .observe(
                this,
                Observer { provider: ProcessCameraProvider? ->
                cameraProvider = provider
                bindAllCameraUseCases()
                }
            )
    }

    private fun bindAllCameraUseCases() {
        if (cameraProvider != null) {
            // As required by CameraX API, unbinds all use cases before trying to re-bind any of them.
            cameraProvider!!.unbindAll()
            bindPreviewUseCase()
            bindAnalysisUseCase()
        }
    }
}
```

We create the builder that will be used to create the preview use case. We can attach some settings to the builder like the image resolution, that can be changed by the user. The previewUseCase is of type Preview which is a camera preview stream for displaying on-screen. Then we attach to the use case a Surface Provider. We are using previewView which is a custom View that displays the camera feed for CameraX's Preview use case. The previewView class manages the Surface lifecycle, as well as the preview aspect ratio and orientation. Internally, it uses either a TextureView or SurfaceView, classes in Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) renderer, to display the camera feed. Finally, we bind the use case to CameraX instance, cameraProvider.

```java
private var previewView: PreviewView? = null
private var previewUseCase: Preview? = null
private var cameraSelector: CameraSelector? = null
private fun bindPreviewUseCase() {
    val builder = Preview.Builder()
    // attach the settings of images resolution
    previewUseCase = builder.build()
    previewUseCase!!.setSurfaceProvider(previewView!!.getSurfaceProvider())
    cameraProvider!!.bindToLifecycle(/* lifecycleOwner= */ this,
      cameraSelector!! /* determines the camera lens to use.*/,
      previewUseCase)
}
```

First we create the analyzing use case and setts the executer, main thread, and its analyzer. The analyzer is where the pose detection, tracking and rendering happens using ML Kit. The analyzer provides the input for the image processor as imageProxy. Image Proxy is a single image buffer.

```java
private var analysisUseCase: ImageAnalysis? = null
private var imageProcessor: VisionImageProcessor? = null
private fun bindAnalysisUseCase() {
    imageProcessor = PoseDetectorProcessor()
    val builder = ImageAnalysis.Builder()
    analysisUseCase = builder.build()
    analysisUseCase?.setAnalyzer(
      ContextCompat.getMainExecutor(this),
      ImageAnalysis.Analyzer {imageProxy: ImageProxy ->
        imageProcessor!!.processImageProxy(imageProxy, graphicOverlay)
      }
    )
    cameraProvider!!.bindToLifecycle(/* lifecycleOwner= */ this, cameraSelector!!, analysisUseCase)
}
```

2. OpenCV

We create an instance of OpenCV with a specified camera lens that allows accessing the current frame and processing it. After processing the frame, we save it as a buffer and yield it to the front end. we use yield since we return a value continuously while executing the function and this value is only needed once.

```py

def generate_frames():
    while camera.isOpened():

        # read the camera frame
        success, frame = camera.read()

        # When the camera unable to read the frame
        if not success:
            break
            
        # process frame and render the landmarks
        
        # Render the frame
        buffer = cv2.imencode('.jpg', frame)[1]
        frame = buffer.tobytes()

        yield (b'--frame\r\n'
               b'Content-Type: image/jpeg\r\n\r\n' + frame + b'\r\n')

``` 

## ML Kit Object detection, tracking and rendering

We set the options of the poseDetectorProcessor in the CameraXLivePreviewActivity, then pass them to PoseDetectorProcessor. PoseDetectorProcessor is an instance of VisionProcessorBase that extracts the result of the detected poses and classifies them. The pose detection and tracking process are done in PoseDetectorProcessor and its patent VisionProcessorBase. The result is of a type Pose and it is passed to the PoseGraph file. The Pose class has a method called getAllLandmark that returns a list of all detected landmarks. The getAllLandmark method will be used to draw some landmarks between the poses that are used to measure the distance. All those tasks are done asynchronously and their results are handled using listeners.

```java
class CameraXLivePreviewActivity :
  AppCompatActivity(), CompoundButton.OnCheckedChangeListener {
    // to give the user the choice of using the CPU or GPU
    val poseDetectorOptions =
        PreferenceUtils.getPoseDetectorOptionsForLivePreview(this)
    val shouldShowInFrameLikelihood =
        PreferenceUtils.shouldShowPoseDetectionInFrameLikelihoodLivePreview(this)
    val visualizeZ = PreferenceUtils.shouldPoseDetectionVisualizeZ(this)
    val rescaleZ =
        PreferenceUtils.shouldPoseDetectionRescaleZForVisualization(this)
    val runClassification =
        PreferenceUtils.shouldPoseDetectionRunClassification(this)
    imageProcessor = PoseDetectorProcessor(
            this,
            poseDetectorOptions,
            shouldShowInFrameLikelihood,
            visualizeZ,
            rescaleZ,
            runClassification,

We load the Movnet model using TensorFlow-hub API. Movenet Multi-pose Lightning model is a convolutional neural network model that predicts the human pose locations of people in the image. The model was designed to be run in the browse (Tfhub.dev, 2022). Then we process the image to fit the Movnet model input specification using TensorFlow API. After passing the frame to the Movnet detector we get the orientation of the detected poses for each person in the frame. We use those orientations to draw and render points and landmarks on the detected person using OpenCV API.

```py
def process_image(frame):
    # Resize image
    img = frame.copy()
    img = tf.image.resize_with_pad(tf.expand_dims(img, axis=0), 384, 640)
    input_img = tf.cast(img, dtype=tf.int32)

    results = movenet(input_img)
    keypoints_with_scores = results['output_0'].numpy()[
        :, :, :51].reshape((6, 17, 3))

    # Render keypoints and landmarks
    loop_through_people(frame, keypoints_with_scores, EDGES, 0.1)
    
def loop_through_people(frame, keypoints_with_scores, edges, confidence_threshold):
    for person in keypoints_with_scores:
        draw_connections(frame, person, edges, confidence_threshold)
        draw_keypoints(frame, person, confidence_threshold)

# Draw Keypoints


def draw_keypoints(frame, keypoints, confidence_threshold):
    y, x, c = frame.shape
    shaped = np.squeeze(np.multiply(keypoints, [y, x, 1]))

    for kp in shaped:
        ky, kx, kp_conf = kp
        if kp_conf > confidence_threshold:
            cv2.circle(frame, (int(kx), int(ky)), 6, (0, 255, 0), -1)


def draw_connections(frame, keypoints, edges, confidence_threshold):
    y, x, c = frame.shape
    shaped = np.squeeze(np.multiply(keypoints, [y, x, 1]))

    for edge, color in edges.items():
        p1, p2 = edge
        y1, x1, c1 = shaped[p1]
        y2, x2, c2 = shaped[p2]

        if (c1 > confidence_threshold) & (c2 > confidence_threshold):
            cv2.line(frame, (int(x1), int(y1)),
                     (int(x2), int(y2)), (0, 0, 255), 4)
            # Measure the distance

## Distance measurement

In order to calculate the distance between the camera and detected person, we calculate the distance between the shoulders and hips. When the user will be closer to the camera this distance will be bigger and as the user gets farther the distance between the shoulder and hips will get smaller. The image shows how the distance between two point on an object changes compare to its position in the real world.

The railroad ties appear to get smaller as they get further away from us.If we measured the apparent size of each railroad tie, their measured size would decrease in proportion to their distance from our eyes. The same thing happens to the distance between shoulders and hips. 
In order to calculate the distance between the camera and detected person, we calculate the distance between the shoulders and hips. We could use the pupillary distance (PD), the distance between the centers of your pupils, since it is fixed as the detected person moves, but it will be affected if the detected person did not face the camera. We used the distance between the shoulders and hips, considering if the detected person rotated.
We get the average of the distance right side and left one, then using a polynomial equation we get how far the detected person is from the camera. The coefficients of the polynomial equation calculate by measuring the size of landmarks, distance between shoulders and hips, to how far a person form the device camera.

## First version

This is first version of the application. It is an Android application. We tried to measure the distance between the camera and any point in the scene using ARCore and SceneForm, and this approach measures the distance based on a 3D understanding of the environment. 
We used the ML Kit Pose detection to detect the human body, and it is the same tool that will be used in the other versions of the application.
Integrating the ARCore part with ML Kit part will require an understanding of managing the ARcore inputs, images, and passing them to the ML Kit part. One of the approaches was to use OpenGL. We were able to implement this approach on a single image, but we could not implement it on a stream of images. One of the main characteristics of java language is that it uses a garbage collector so we have to save the image buffer into the heap. It seems that applying the detection on a stream of images is possible but will require more understanding of OpenGL. Learning OpenGL exceeded the estimated time and considering the risks effects and strategies, we adopted another approach.

## Unit testing

1. the application asks for permissions
2. the user can start the camera
3. the user can see a stream of camera images
4. the application can detect pose body
5. the application can render landmarks
6. the application can show the alert massage
7. the application can measure how far the detected person is from the camera
8. the user can access settings
9. edit the safe distance
10. the user can render the distance on detected person
11. the user can stop rendering landmarks
12. the user can use GPU instead of CPU

## 

asks for permissions
start the camera
stream camera images
detect a person
render landmarks
render the current distance on detected person
show the alert massage
access settings
edit the safe distance
render the distance on detected person
stop rendering landmarks
use GPU instead of CPU

The application asks for camera and internet permissions, it will shows a pop-up window to get the user approval.
when the user click on start the application camera, the application will take the user to the CameraX activity.
The CameraX activity will show a stream of images of the current scene.
the application shows a massage when a person got detected
the application renders landmarks between shoulders and hips on the detected person
the application renders the current distance between the detected person and the camera
the application shows an alert massage when the person violate the safe distance
when the user clicks on settings icon, the application will take the user to the settings activity
the user should be able to change the safe distance
the user should be able to control showing landmarks
the user should be able to control showing the current distance on detected person
the user should be able to control using the device GPU instead of CPU.
when the user clicks on close the camera, the application will take the user back to the entry activity


# 8 conc

To conclude, this project delivers three applications that can measure the distance between the device camera and the detected person. The project aims to help users to keep a predefined distance between people around them. The project presented two approaches for measuring the distance using the device camera. The first approach is based on 3 dimensional understanding of the environment. The second approach is based on 2 dimensional understanding of the image. During this project, two applications were developed for Android devices, and another application was developed using the Flask framework. This experience was a great opportunity to use and contribute to a bigger journey of promising technology such as Augmented reality.

ARCore
ARCore, also known as 'Google Play Services for AR', is a Google software development kit that allows developers to create augmented reality apps. It was first launched in 2018 and since then has made its way to a lot of smartphones far and wide from several manufacturers. ARCore uses simultaneous localization and mapping, or SLAM, to understand where the phone is exactly relative to the world around it. It manages to compute changes in location by detecting visually distinct features in the captured camera image and then using that as feature points to know if it changed location and the features of that location. It uses these feature points to detect planes or horizontal/vertical surfaces and uses that for additional context.

Sceneform, the 3D rendering library for building AR applications on Android. Sceneform is a 3D framework with a physically based renderer that's optimized for mobile devices and that makes it easy for you to build augmented reality apps without requiring OpenGL(google-ar, 2020).
